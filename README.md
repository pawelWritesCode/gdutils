# GDUTILS

## Simple library with methods useful for e2e testing of HTTP(s) API.

Library is suitable for steps in godog framework.

### Downloading

`go get github.com/pawelWritesCode/gdutils`

### Related project:

Skeleton that allows to write e2e tests using *godog & gdutils* almost instantly with minimal configuration.

### Roadmap (not yet implemented ideas):

- [ ] New method for **adding cookies to HTTP(s) request**
- [ ] New method for **saving fixed values from scenario under provided cache key** (not only from HTTP(s) response)
- [ ] New method for asserting on HTTP(s) response using cucumber datatable (field | matcher | type | value )
- [ ] New method for asserting on **HTTP(s) request-response time**
- [ ] Upgrade assertion for validating last HTTP(s) response with **user provided (as []bytes)** JSON schema
- [x] Upgrade assertion for validating last HTTP(s) response against JSON Schema **to accept URL**
- [ ] Upgrade assertion using qjson-jsonpath to accept another jsonpath library
  syntax: (https://github.com/oliveagle/jsonpath)
